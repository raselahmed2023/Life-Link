# 🩸 LifeLink

LifeLink is a responsive blood donor discovery frontend built with Next.js. It helps users search for donors by blood group, location, and availability, view donor profiles, and submit privacy-focused contact requests.

> **Project status:** Frontend MVP. Donor data is currently stored as mock data, while login, registration, and contact-request submissions are UI simulations.

##  Run Locally

### Prerequisites

Install the following before starting:

- Node.js
- npm
- Git

### 1. Clone the public repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raselahmed2023/Life-Link.git
```

### 2. Enter the project folder

```bash
cd Life-Link
```

### 3. Install dependencies

For a normal local setup:

```bash
npm install
```

For an installation that follows `package-lock.json` exactly:

```bash
npm ci
```

Use only one of the two installation commands.

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Open the application

Visit:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

No environment variables are currently required.

> The project uses Google-hosted Geist fonts and remote images, so an internet connection is required during the first development or production build and while loading those remote assets.

##  Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run build` | Create an optimized production build |
| `npm run start` | Run the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

##  Run the Production Build Locally

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

##  Privacy Approach

LifeLink does not display donor phone numbers publicly. The donor-details page provides a contact-request form containing:

- Patient name
- Hospital or location
- Urgency level

In the current frontend MVP, submission is simulated and no request is stored in a database.
